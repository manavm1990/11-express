# Node Starter

~~**Update:** A `pnpm-lock.yaml` file was added to the root of the project. If possible use `pnpm` over `npm`. You might like it better. See [the docs 📝](https://pnpm.io/motivation) if interested. If not, delete this file.~~

## TLDR

Use of this starter template assumes that you have a 'complete dev environment' setup - a terminal, Node, VS Code, at least. If not, you may want to [start here.](https://www.notion.so/codefinity/Setting-up-a-Local-Dev-Environment-for-JS-02a4e9f4a30043d3a8e7d109be3448f4)

1. Click that big green button to start using it.
2. `clone` your new repo from your GitHub to your local computer
3. `cd` into the `clone`d repo and enter: `npm i`.
4. `npm start`

## Some of What's Included

- [![code style: prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
- Various VS Code 'settings' and 'extensions.' Look in the bottom right when you open this up in VS Code to install them.
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for testing. Just do `npm test` or `npm t`.

## How To Use

Run `npm i` to get all the things installed.

`npm start` will watch the `app` directory for any changes using `nodemon`

## Other Notes

To use the new experimental `fetch` that's now in Node, just add: `/* global fetch */` to the top of your file. This will appease ESLint.
